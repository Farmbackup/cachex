  Notifies a listener of the passed in data. If the data is a list, we convert it
  to a tuple in order to make it easier to pattern match against. We accept a list
  of listeners in order to allow for multiple (plugin style) listeners. Initially
  had the empty clause at the top but this way is better (at the very worst it's
  the same performance).
